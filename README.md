I’ve documented everything in a two-part series. The Remix supporting `mdx` is totally a mind-blowing for me. :exploding_head: :exploding_head: Writing JSX in your markdown content is very fun!<br/>

This is [part one](https://medium.com/@xianli_74374/how-to-seamlessly-integrate-mdx-in-a-remix-based-project-part-one-c4ff49a20381) and [part two](https://medium.com/@xianli_74374/how-to-seamlessly-integrate-mdx-in-a-remix-based-project-part-two-116d9540b514). These two articles are behind the paywall.<br/>

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
